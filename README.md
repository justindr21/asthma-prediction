the best uses for computer science are often the ones least related to the tech world. things like healthcare particularly catch my eye as they initially seem too distant to even be relevant. i love the idea of visiting disciplines that i dont have the luxury or interest-as-a-child-but-now-im-interested-in-it to explore, like the life sciences. i hope i get to do more of this





my apprehension towards ai might have gone unchecked if i hadn't had the privilege to learn how some of these things work. unfortunately the practical aspect of things are always a little less engaging but its kinda like adding ketchup to poutine. the fries is the topic of machine learning, the gravy (which i kinda dont really care for but is essential to the dish) is the practical aspect of computer science, and ketchup is the unecessary add-on, which in this case, is the setting of the healthcare industry. so yeah i hope that makes sense. 

anyways, to run it, just load it R Studio. you can install R Studio from one of the first links that pops up when you google "download R Studio". then run it.
